### CS3Plugs: A curated list of cs3 plugins that mostly work.
CS3Plugs is a repository that contains a list of plugins that work universally everywhere. Most of them work if you use a DNS in-built with [Cloudstream](https://github.com/recloudstream/cloudstream). 

```All credits to the respective source providers and plugin developers. I take absolutely no credit over the development of these plugins, I have simply created a "repo" with a list of them that you can import into CS3.```
**It is suggested to install all extensions, it's not necessary, but I suggest it :)**
