# CS3Plugs: A curated list of CS3 plugins that just work

**CS3Plugs** is a repository that contains a collection of plugins compatible with [Cloudstream 3](https://github.com/recloudstream/cloudstream). Most of these plugins work universally, especially when using the built-in DNS within Cloudstream. However, many should function correctly even without it.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> All credits go to the respective content providers and plugin developers. I do **not** claim ownership or credit for the development of these plugins. This repository simply serves as a convenient list you can import into Cloudstream 3.
